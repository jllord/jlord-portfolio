			<h6><small>Hi</small></h6>
			<p class="biobody">My thing is communicating issues - from urban systems to government transparency. I strive to make information
			simple, clear and meaningful. I'm optimistic (and Â¡energetic!) about creating impact and behavioral change. 
			My background is in architecture and urban design but I've a got a strong tech side and am focusing
			on using those skills to communicate through the web. I'm big on cities, open source, javascript, coffee, bikes and 
			the awesome community of other folks who feel the same.</p> 
			<p class="biobody">I hail from the heart of Georgia but for now I live in Oakland, California. <a href="http://mailto:to.jlord@gmail.com">Let me know</a> if you have a project in mind.</p>
		
			<h3 class="capTitle">...</h3>
			<ul><li>After an urban design study abroad year in Paris my senior year of college I shifted my focus from architecture to urban design. While working in architecture after graduation I quickly learned new Building Information Modeling software
				and started visualizing the built environment, working on single family and multi-family scale projects from concept to construction documents as well as earning LEED BD&C accreditation. Working for the City of Boston in the Boston Redevelopment Authority's
				Urban Design Technology group I contributed to and visualized design guidelines, height regulations, project reviews and earned LEED ND accreditation. I worked across departments often with Economic Development and the Mayor's Office of New Urban Mechanics. 
				In 2012 I was accepted as a Code for America Fellow and focused on designing and building lightweight, open source technology for city government.

			<h3 class="capTitle">About this Site</h3>
			<ul><li>I built this site from scratch using <a href="http://viewportindustries.com/products/starkers/" target="_blank">Starkers</a>, a naked Wordpress theme. 
			I rounded it out with some jquery and javascript, which I'll blog about soon. The typefaces are <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Open+Sans" target="_blank">Open Sans</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Merriweather" target="_blank">Merriweather</a>, both from Google Web Fonts.
